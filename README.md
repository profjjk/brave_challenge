# Brave Challenge

You are tasked with creating a single page application that allows users to search for Star Wars movies by title and display the results in a list. When the user clicks on a movie from the list, they should be taken to a details page that displays additional information about the selected movie.

## Instructions:
- The following test is designed to evaluate your proficiency in using ReactJS and consuming an external API (swapi.dev).
- Please create a new ReactJS project and submit the code along with a brief explanation of your approach.
- You are allowed to use any additional library or framework to achieve the following requirements.
- Feel free to ask any questions or clarifications as needed.

## Requirements:
- The application should have two pages: a search page and a movie details page.
- On the search page, the user should be able to enter a search query in a search box and click on a "search" button to retrieve a list of matching movies from swapi.dev.
- The search results should be displayed as a list of movie titles. When the user clicks on a movie title, they should be taken to the movie details page.
- On the movie details page, the user should be able to see the following information about the selected movie: title, director, release date, and opening crawl.
- The application should be responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices.
- You should use Git to track your code changes and submit your final project as a Github repository.
- Bonus points for using Redux or any other state management library to manage the application's state.
- Bonus points for implementing any additional features or improvements that you think would enhance the application's user experience.
